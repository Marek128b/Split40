## Description 

The ErgoSplit50 is a 50% split keyboard which means that the keyboard is in two half's which is better for ergonomics than a "normal" keyboard. A 50% Keyboard is smaller compared to a normal 100% keyboard with function and number keys as well as a num keys.
The Keyboard has a ortho linear key layout which is more ergonomic than the staggered key layout (normal layout).
