## Description 
The split40 is a 40% split keyboard which means that the keyboard is in two half's which is better for ergonomics than a "normal" keyboard. A 40% Keyboard is smaller compared to a normal 100% keyboard with function and number keys as well as a num keys.
The Keyboard has a ortho linear key layout which is more ergonomic than the staggered key layout (normal layout).
